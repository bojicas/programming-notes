# Webstorm and ES6 in React

Webstorm 2016.1 doesn't fully support React with ES6 syntax, so I find it useful to disable some inspections:

1. Method can be static
2. Signature mismatch
3. Unresolved JavaScript variable
4. Unused JavaScript / ActionScript global symbol

To compensate for the above disabled inspections, I like to enable ESLint.
